# HYBRID-VISION-TRANSFORMER-APPROACH-TO-STRENGHTEN-SIGNATURE-VERIFICATION
A Deep Learning model that actively generates and modifies data for improved handwritten signature verification. It uses a variation consistency mechanism with a discriminator, extractor, and verifier trained adversarially. Tested on four signature datasets, including Synthetic Signature, achieving high accuracy. ðŸš€
Verification of handwritten signatures is an important yet difficult problem. Although earlier research has made significant strides in this area, they passively learn signature traits from the available data. In this work, we provide a unique Deep Learning model for verifying handwritten signatures that actively modifies current data and creates new data to mine effective features. Powered by a proposed novel variation consistency mechanism, the Deep Learning contains three different types of modules unified under one end-to-end framework: To build a more discriminating model, the discriminator actively generates signature variations. At the same time, the extractor looks for deep discriminating features in handwritten signatures. The discriminator then uses the extracted features to make verification judgments. The suggested model is adversarially trained using a min-max loss function, which allows the three modules to work together and compete to improve the overall model's performance and, consequently, the signature verification performance. We put the suggested approach to the test using four difficult signature datasets: Synthetic Signature. The success of the suggested approach is confirmed by extensive experiments and in-depth talks.
